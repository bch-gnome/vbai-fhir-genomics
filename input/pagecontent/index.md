### Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the field of healthcare, providing various tools and techniques that can help to improve diagnosis, treatment, and patient outcomes. One of the many areas where AI can make a major impact in the field of healthcare is in the integrative analysis and interpretation of genomic data. With the growing amount and improved quality of available genomic data, AI will play an increasingly important role by helping researchers and clinicians to better understand the role of genetics on complex traits, and to develop more effective treatments for each patient.

The Bridge2AI Voice as a Biomarker of Health (VBAI) project aims to combine genomic, clinical, bio-acoustic data from healthcare units across multiple institutes for scientific inquiry and AI/ML algorithm development. With genomic data being generated by different institutions and platforms, ensuring that data can be easily shared and integrated is crucial. The process of harmonizing genomic data from different sources and platforms will greatly benefit from adaptation of consistent data standards. Harmonized data will improve AI-based genomic data analysis by providing larger and more diverse collections of data.

### Dependencies

VBAI Genomics is a part of the overarching project for the VBAI study:

### Organization of this guide

1. [Overview](1_overview.html) of profiles used in this implementation guide.

The following sections focuse on the standardization of genomic data generated in VBAI project in terms of:

2. [the procedures by which genomic data were generated](2_workflow.html).
3. [the quality metrics of the genomic data](3_metric.html).
4. [the representation for the observed genetic variants](4_variant_representation.html).
